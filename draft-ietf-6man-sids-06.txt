      SRv6 Segment Identifiers in the IPv6 Addressing Architecture
                        draft-ietf-6man-sids-06

Abstract

   The data plane for Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) is built using
   IPv6 as the underlying forwarding plane.  Due to this underlying use
   of IPv6, Segment Identifiers (SIDs) used by SRv6 behave like IPv6
   addresses outside the SR domain while exhibiting slightly different
   behaviors inside the SR domain.  This document explores the
   characteristics of SRv6 SIDs and focuses on the relationship of SRv6
   SIDs to the IPv6 Addressing Architecture.  This document allocates
   and makes a dedicated prefix available for SRv6 SIDs.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) [RFC8754] uses IPv6 as the
   underlying data plane.  In SRv6, SR source nodes initiate packets
   with a segment identifier in the Destination Address of the IPv6
   header, and SR segment endpoint nodes process a local segment present
   in the Destination Address of an IPv6 header.  Thus Segment
   Identifiers (SIDs) in SRv6 can and do appear in the Destination
   Address of IPv6 datagrams by design. While these destination addresses
   are processed by SRv6 unaware IPv6 nodes they are treated as routing 
   prefixes as described in Section 3. This document explores the
   characteristics of SRv6 SIDs and focuses on the relationship of SRv6
   SIDs to the IPv6 Addressing Architecture [RFC4291].  This document
   allocates and makes a dedicated prefix available for SRv6 SIDs.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are used as defined in [RFC8402].

   *  Segment Routing (SR)

   *  SR Domain

   *  Segment

   *  Segment Identifier (SID)

Internet-Draft                  SRv6 SIDs                  February 2024


   *  SRv6

   *  SRv6 SID

   The following terms are used as defined in [RFC8754].

   *  Segment Routing Header (SRH)

   *  SR Source Node

   *  Transit Node

   *  SR Segment Endpoint Node

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  SRv6 SIDs and the IPv6 Addressing Architecture

   [RFC8754] defines the Segment List of the SRH as a contiguous array
   of 128-bit IPv6 addresses, and that each of the elements in this list
   are SIDs.  But all of these elements are not necessarily made equal.
   Some of these elements may represent a local interface as described
   in Section 4.3 of [RFC8754] as "A FIB entry that represents a local
   interface, not locally instantiated as an SRv6 SID".  From this it
   follows that not all the SIDs that appear in the SRH are SRv6 SIDs as
   defined by [RFC8402].

   As stated above, the non-SRv6-SID elements that appear in the SRH SID
   list are simply IPv6 addresses assigned to local interfaces and they
   need to conform to [RFC4291].  So, the following discussions are
   applicable solely to SRv6 SIDs that are not assigned to local
   interfaces.

   One of the key questions to address is how these SRv6 SIDs appearing
   as IPv6 Destination Addresses are perceived and treated by "transit
   nodes" (that are not required to be capable of processing a Segment
   or the Segment Routing Header).

   Section 3.1. of [RFC8986] describes the format of an SRv6 SID as
   composed of three parts LOC:FUNCT:ARG, where a locator (LOC) is
   encoded in the L most significant bits of the SID, followed by F bits
   of function (FUNCT) and A bits of arguments (ARG).  If L+F+A < 128,
   the ARG is followed by enough zero bits to fill the 128 bit SID.
   Such an SRv6 SID is assigned to a node within a prefix defined as a

   Locator of length L.  When an SRv6 SID occurs in the IPv6 Destination
   Address of an IPv6 header, only the longest match prefix
   corresponding to the Locator [BCP198] is used by the transit node to
   forward the packet to the node identified by the Locator.

   It is clear that this format for SRv6 SIDs is not compliant with the
   requirements set forth in [RFC4291] for IPv6 addresses but it is also
   clear that SRv6 SIDs are not intended for assignment onto interfaces
   on end hosts.  They look and act similarly to other mechanisms that
   use IPv6 addresses with different formats such as [RFC6052] that
   defines the IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators and [RFC7343]
   that describes ORCHIDv2 (a cryptographic hash identifier format).

   While looking at the transit nodes it becomes apparent that these
   addresses are used purely for forwarding and not for packet delivery
   to end hosts.  Hence the relevant specification to apply here is
   [BCP198] that requires implementations to support the use of variable
   length prefixes in forwarding while explicitly decoupling IPv6
   routing and forwarding from the IPv6 address/prefix semantics
   described in [RFC4291].  Please note that [BCP198] does not override
   the rules in [RFC4291], but merely limits where their impact is
   observed.

   Furthermore, in the SRv6 specifications, all SIDs assigned within a
   given Locator prefix are located inside the node identified by
   Locator.  Therefore there does not appear to be a conflict with
   section 2.6.1 of [RFC4291] since subnet-router anycast addresses are
   neither required nor useful within a node.

4.  Special Considerations for Compressed SIDs

   [CSID] introduces an encoding for compressed segment lists (C-SIDs),
   and describes how to use a single entry in the Segment list as a
   container for multiple SIDs.  A node taking part in this mechanism
   accomplishes this by using the ARG part [RFC8986] of the Destination
   Address of the IPv6 header to derive a new Destination Address. i.e.,
   the Destination Address field of the packet changes at a segment
   endpoint in a way similar to how the address changes as the result of
   processing a segment in the SRH.

   One key thing to note here is that the Locator Block at the beginning
   of the address does not get modified by the operations needed for
   supporting compressed SIDs.  As we have established that the SRv6
   SIDs are being treated simply as routing prefixes on transit nodes
   within the SR domain this does not constitute a modification to the
   IPv6 data plane on such transit nodes and any changes are restricted
   to SR aware nodes.

5.  Allocation of a Global Unicast Prefix for SIDs

   All of the SRv6 related specifications discussed above are intended
   to be applicable to a contained SR Domain or between collaborating SR
   Domains.  Nodes either inside or outside the SR Domains that are not
   SR-aware will not perform any special behavior for SRv6 SIDs and will
   treat them solely as IPv6 routing prefixes.

   As an added factor of security, it is desirable to allocate some
   address space that explicitly signals that the addresses within that
   space cannot be expected to comply with [RFC4291].  As described in
   Section 3 above, there is precedent for mechanisms that use IPv6
   addresses in a manner different from that specified in [RFC4291].
   This would be useful in identifying and potentially filtering packets
   at the edges of the SR Domains to make it simpler for the SR domain
   to fail closed.

   At the present time, global DNS [RFC8499] SHOULD NOT reference
   addresses assigned from this block.  Further specifications are
   needed to describe the conventions and guidelines for the use of this
   newly allocated address block.  The SRv6 operational community, which
   is the first intended user of this block, is requested to come up
   with such conventions and guidelines in line with their requirements.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign the following /16 address block from the
   IPv6 Unicast Address Registry [UNICAST] for the purposes described in
   Section 5 and record the allocation in the IPv6 Special-Purpose
   Address Registry [SPECIAL].

   Address Block: 5f00::/16
   Name: Segment Routing (SRv6) SIDs
   RFC: This document
   Allocation Date: Allocation Date
   Termination Date: N/A
   Source: True
   Destination: True
   Forwardable: True
   Globally Reachable: False
   Reserved-by-Protocol: False

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the use of Segment Routing [RFC8402],
   SRv6 [RFC8754], and SRv6 network programming [RFC8986] apply to the
   use of these addresses.  The use of IPv6 tunneling mechanisms
   (including SRv6) also brings up additional concerns such as those
   described in [RFC6169].  The usage of the prefix allocated by this
   document improves security by making it simpler to filter traffic at
   the edge of the SR domains.

   In case the deployments do not use this allocated prefix, additional
   care needs to be exercised at network ingress and egress points so
   that SRv6 packets do not leak out of SR domains and they do not
   accidentally enter SR unaware domains.  Similarly, as stated in
   Section 5.1 of [RFC8754], the SR domain needs to be configured to
   filter out packets entering that use the selected prefix.
